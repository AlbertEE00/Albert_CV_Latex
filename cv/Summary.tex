I am a passionate and hard working, fourth and final year Electrical and Electronic Engineering student studying at Stellenbosch University, with an interest in the fields of Engineering, Science and Technology.  
I am extremely interested in all aspects of electronics, including: computers,  robotics, smart-phones, micro-electronics, and IC manufacturing.  
My dream has always been to study and learn how to design and build these devices so that I can be a part of the development and advancement of society and the technologies we use. Having almost done so, I hope to successfully apply my engineering mind and skills to the needs of the companies building our technology driven future.
